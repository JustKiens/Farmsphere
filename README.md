## Project Description
FarmSphere is an innovative platform that monitors the inventory of crops in the provinces of Region III, providing real-time data on agricultural supply. The platform integrates **blockchain** and **data analytics** to enhance transparency, security, and sustainability. It aims to optimize production, reduce waste, and improve resource management for local farmers.

### Features:
1. **Real-time Supply Monitoring** - Provides farmers with real-time data on crop yields, inventory, and logistics.
2. **Blockchain-Driven Transparency** - Ensures a secure and unchangeable record of each transaction in the agricultural supply chain.
3. **Secure Data Sharing and Collaboration** - Facilitates data sharing across the region, ensuring balanced agricultural stock levels.
4. **Farmer Empowerment and Education** - Functions as a hub for farmers, providing them with access to data for informed decision-making.

## Objectives:
FarmSphere supports the following UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
- **SDG 1:** No Poverty – with the used of FarmSphere the poverty problem around the nation, particularly for small-scaled farmers will be given a solution with the tools and resources improved productivity by utilizing the web-based system. By giving them real-time - --data on crop yields, market demands, and supplies around the area it gives them the timing, the right decision to meet the markets demands efficiently, reducing losses and maximizing the revenue. Additionally, the transparency of the data provided by the technology of blockchain ensures that the farmers will receive an equal fair price for their products, and the buyers can verify its authenticity and quality of the crops that are being produced.
- **SDG 2:** Zero Hunger – FarmSphere also aims to eliminate hunger by optimizing food production, reducing food waste, improved supply chain transparency, and increased access to nutritious foods, as the system enables the farmers to monitor their crop conditions and make-data driven decisions that improve the quality of its agricultural productivity, also providing tools that allows farmers to track their inventory, monitor the supply chain around the area and predict the yields of crop more accurately resulting on a fair distribution and makes it easier for organizations and governments to track food supplies, ensuring that it will reach every populations.
- **SDG 8:** Decent Work and Economic Growth -  Decent Work and Economic Growth – FarmSphere uses tools to improve productivity, market access, and income. This promotes fair compensation to all farmers with the use of blockchain transparency. This fosters a sustainable farming practice which leads to the improvement of long-term productivity which reduces cost and contributes to the economic growth. Therefore, the platform creates job opportunities to small-scaled and local farmers by increasing their profitability with the adaption of the technology enabling a direct market connection.
- **SDG 10:** Reduced Inequality – The system reduces the inequality by empowering farmers whether small-scaled or large-scaled farmers, giving both an access to better market their crops with fair compensation and financial inclusion. The blockchain transparency ensures that each farmer can compete on a level playing field. FarmsSphere helps bridge the gap between the small farmers and the large producers.
- **SDG 17:** Partnerships for the Goals – FarmSphere fosters collaboration across agricultural supply chain, allowing the farmers and the Department of Agriculture, connect through a transparent blockchain-based platform. This enables partnership from farmers and government allowing a collaborative space that caters the needs of both the food demand and farmer needs. By the integration of the modern technology, FarmSphere provides innovation and collective progress for sustainability and economic growth. This enhances the accountability and monitoring of SDG goals making it a powerful platform for cooperation and shared responsibilities in the agricultural aspects.
